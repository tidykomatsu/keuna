## 🔄 Migration Algorithm Details

### Priority Score Calculation

```
Initial State:
- Never answered: priority = 3.0 (medium)

After Each Answer:
- Correct: priority = max(priority - 2.0, -10.0)
- Wrong:   priority = min(priority + 5.0, 50.0)

Streak Tracking:
- Correct: streak += 1
- Wrong:   streak = 0
```

### Weighted Selection Process

1. **Load Questions** - Get all questions (or filter by topic)
2. **Join Performance** - Left join with user_question_performance
3. **Calculate Weights**:
   - Never answered: weight = 3.0
   - High priority (>0): weight = priority_score
   - Low priority (<0): weight = abs(priority_score) * 0.1 + 0.5
4. **Normalize** - weights = weights / sum(weights)
5. **Select** - random.choices() with normalized weights

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New User**
- All questions have weight = 3.0
- Effectively random selection
- As they answer, weights diverge

**Scenario 2: Experienced User**
- Wrong answers: priority ≈ 15-30 → high weight
- Correct streak: priority ≈ -8 to -2 → low weight
- System focuses on weak areas

**Scenario 3: Topic Focus**
- Filter to single topic
- Same algorithm applies within topic
- User masters topic → priorities drop

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Smart Question Selection
1. **Answer a question wrong** → Priority increases → Shows more often
2. **Answer a question right** → Priority decreases → Shows less often
3. **Long correct streak** → Priority goes negative → Rarely shown
4. **Switch modes anytime** → Immediate effect on next question

### Data Persistence
1. **Answer questions** → Saved to Supabase
2. **Close browser** → Data persists
3. **Streamlit Cloud restarts** → Data still there
4. **Multiple users** → Separate isolated data

### Performance Tracking
1. **Every answer** → Trigger updates stats
2. **View statistics** → Real-time aggregated data
3. **Topic performance** → Per-topic accuracy and priority
4. **Question history** → Complete answer log

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Initial Selection**
   - First 10-20 questions are mostly random (no performance data yet)
   - This is expected and improves over time

2. **Algorithm Tuning**
   - Priority score adjustments (-2.0/+5.0) are initial values
   - May need tuning based on user feedback

3. **Topic Coverage**
   - Adaptive mode might neglect topics user hasn't seen
   - Recommend periodic use of "unanswered" mode

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Question difficulty estimation
   - Learning rate calculation
   - Predicted exam score

3. **Social Features**
   - Leaderboards
   - Study groups
   - Shared flashcard decks
